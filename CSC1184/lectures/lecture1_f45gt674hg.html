          <h1>Week 1 – Programming for Data Analysis: Mindset & Warm-Up</h1>

          <p class="lede">
            CSC1184 is a second-year module about using Python to work with data: loading it,
            cleaning it, exploring it, and building simple models. In this first week we focus on
            language and mindset rather than heavy code: what counts as “data”, what kinds of
            questions we can ask, and how the Python you learned earlier fits into that picture.
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout-goal">
            <span class="callout-title">By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Explain what “programming for data analysis” means in plain language.</li>
              <li>Use terms like <em>dataset</em>, <em>observation</em>, and <em>variable</em> correctly.</li>
              <li>Recognise a simple workflow from question → data → conclusion.</li>
              <li>Describe where Python and its data libraries fit into that workflow.</li>
              <li>Read and modify small Python examples that analyse lists of numbers.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="callout callout-idea">
            <span class="callout-title">Big idea</span>
            In this module, code is not the “final product”. The real goal is the <strong>insight
            you get from the data</strong> and how clearly you can explain it to someone else.
          </div>
        </header>

        <!-- 1. WHAT IS PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYSIS? -->
        <h2 id="pda">1. What Is Programming for Data Analysis?</h2>

        <p>
          In first-year programming you often wrote code to solve small, self-contained problems:
          tax calculators, guessing games, simple simulations. In this module, the problems start
          with <strong>data</strong>. You have measurements, logs, survey responses, or records,
          and you want to learn something from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can think of “programming for data analysis” as sitting at the intersection of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming</strong> – writing correct, readable Python code.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistics</strong> – reasoning about variability, averages, relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Domain questions</strong> – what you actually care about (students, finance, sports, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A data-analysis task might be as simple as “What is the typical exam score?” or as
          ambitious as “Can we predict who will pass?” Either way, your Python skills are there to
          help you move from raw data to a clear, evidence-based answer.
        </p>

        </div>

        <!-- 2. DATASETS, VARIABLES & OBSERVATIONS -->
        <h2 id="data-vocab">2. Datasets, Variables &amp; Observations</h2>

        <p>
          Most of the time, we will picture data as a table, similar to a spreadsheet:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A <strong>dataset</strong> is the entire table – all rows and all columns together.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <strong>observation</strong> (or record) is one row – one student, one match,
            one transaction, one day.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>variable</strong> is one column – something we measure or record about
            each observation (age, score, programme, price, category, date).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.1 Types of variables</h3>

        <p>
          Different types of variables call for different plots, summaries, and models. For this
          module, it is enough to recognise three broad types:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Numeric</strong> – things you can sensibly add and average (age, score, height, price).</li>
          <li><strong>Categorical</strong> – labels or groups (programme, country, grade band, product category).</li>
          <li><strong>Time-based</strong> – dates and times (exam date, timestamp of a log entry).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="activity-box">
          <span class="box-title">Activity – Spot observations and variables</span>
          Think of a dataset you might actually see in your degree: module marks, lab attendance,
          or a small log of system requests. What is one observation in that dataset? List three
          variables you could record about it.
        </div>

        <!-- 3. KINDS OF QUESTIONS -->
        <h2 id="kinds-of-questions">3. Kinds of Questions We Ask About Data</h2>

        <p>
          Not all data-analysis questions are the same. It helps to name a few common types, both
          so you can frame your own questions and so you can recognise what a client or colleague
          is really asking for.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Descriptive</strong> – “What does this dataset look like?”  
            Examples: distribution of exam marks, number of students per programme, average daily
            temperature over a month.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative</strong> – “Are these groups different?”  
            Examples: average score in two different modules, sales before vs after a promotion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relational</strong> – “Are these variables related?”  
            Examples: relationship between lab attendance and exam score; price vs size for
            houses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Predictive</strong> – “Can we predict one thing from others?”  
            Examples: predict exam score from coursework and attendance; predict whether a customer
            will buy again.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this module we will mainly tackle descriptive, comparative, and relational questions,
          with a gentle introduction to predictive models later in the semester.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. WORKFLOW -->
        <h2 id="workflow">4. A Simple Data Analysis Workflow</h2>

        <p>
          Many data-science workflows follow a similar pattern: start from a question, obtain
          data, clean it, explore it, build a model, and communicate results. The exact diagram
          differs between sources, but the core pattern is the same.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 The stages in more detail</h3>

        <div class="split-row">
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Ask</h4>
            <p>
              Clarify what you want to know. “Is attendance related to marks?” is clearer and more
              testable than “Is this dataset interesting?”. A good question mentions the variables
              you care about and the kind of comparison or pattern you are interested in.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Obtain</h4>
            <p>
              Get data from somewhere: CSV exports, databases, log files, APIs, manual entry.
              In this module we mainly use CSV files and small text files, but the same ideas
              extend to larger systems. You should always ask where the data came from and how it
              was collected.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="split-row">
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Clean</h4>
            <p>
              Fix obvious problems: missing values, wrong types, duplicated rows, inconsistent
              labels (for example, “CS”, “Computer Science”, and “CompSci” being used for the same
              programme). Cleaning is often the longest part of a project and has a big impact on
              the quality of your conclusions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Explore</h4>
            <p>
              Compute summaries and create plots to understand distributions, patterns, and
              anomalies. You might look at averages, histograms, boxplots, or simple scatterplots.
              The goal here is curiosity: get a feel for the data before committing to any one
              model or story.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="split-row">
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Model</h4>
            <p>
              Fit a simple model to capture a relationship or make basic predictions. In this
              module that might be a linear regression or a simple classifier. A model should be
              interpretable and checked against the data; it is not a magic answer generator.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="split-card">
            <h4>Communicate</h4>
            <p>
              Turn your work into something another person can read or act on: a short report,
              a slide deck, or a notebook with commentary. Good communication explains what you
              did, what you found, and what the limitations are, rather than just dumping code
              and numbers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The rest of the module essentially walks this workflow with increasing levels of
          sophistication. Week 1 sits mainly in “Ask” and “Explore” for very small datasets.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. PYTHON'S ROLE -->
        <h2 id="python-role">5. Why Python? Where This Module Fits</h2>

        <p>
          Python is widely used in data analysis because of the ecosystem around it: NumPy for
          efficient arrays, pandas for data tables, Matplotlib and other libraries for plots,
          scikit-learn for models, and so on. This module does not try to cover everything; it
          focuses on the ideas and tools you are likely to see again.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSC1184 aims to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Strengthen your basic Python when applied to data rather than toy puzzles.</li>
          <li>Introduce core libraries (NumPy, pandas, basic plotting) at a comfortable pace.</li>
          <li>Give you a solid mental model of the data-analysis workflow.</li>
          <li>Prepare you to read and adapt examples from standard Python data-analysis resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In Week 1 and Week 2 we stay close to “plain” Python and small tables so that when we add
          libraries, they feel like natural extensions rather than magic.
        </p>

        <!-- 6. PYTHON REFRESH -->
        <h2 id="python-refresh">6. Python Refresh: Lists &amp; Built-ins</h2>

        <p>
          Before we look at the code examples, we slow down and name exactly what kinds of
          Python objects we are using and what the basic operations mean. In Week 1 we only need:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Numbers</strong> (integers and floats).</li>
          <li><strong>Lists</strong> (ordered collections of values).</li>
          <li><strong>Built-in functions</strong> like <code>len</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>print</code>.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple loops</strong> with <code>for</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.1 What is a list?</h3>

        <p>
          A <strong>list</strong> in Python is an ordered collection of items. Important properties:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Written with square brackets, for example:
            <code>[55, 62, 71, 48]</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The order matters: the first element is at position 0, the second at 1, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can access a single element by its index, e.g. <code>scores[0]</code> is the first
            score, <code>scores[1]</code> the second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lists are <strong>mutable</strong>: after creating a list, you can change, add, or
            remove elements (for example, <code>scores.append(100)</code> to add a value).
          </li>
          <li>
            Lists can grow or shrink: you are not stuck with a fixed size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technically, a list can contain values of different types, but in data analysis we
            usually keep one list to “one meaning” (for example, all exam scores, all temperatures,
            or all daily study times).
          </li>
        </ul>

<p>Here is a small example you can talk through and also run:</p>

<section class="card" id="ex-list">
  <div class="card-head">
    <div class="file-name">Example – A Small List</div>
    <div class="toolbar">

      <button class="btn clear">Clear</button>
      <button class="btn reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="lecture-stack">
      <div class="editor-pane">
<textarea class="code" spellcheck="false">
# A tiny list of exam scores.
scores = [55, 62, 71, 48]

print("The whole list:", scores)

print("First score:", scores[0])
print("Second score:", scores[1])

print("Number of scores:", len(scores))
</textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="output-pane">
        <div class="output-label">Terminal Output</div>
        <pre class="output-box" aria-live="polite"></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="status">
    <span class="dot"></span><span class="status-text">Ready</span>
  </div>
</section>

        <p>
          In this lecture we treat a list of numbers as a tiny dataset: a mini “column” of values
          that we want to summarise or count.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 What is a function?</h3>

        <p>
          At a high level, a <strong>function</strong> is a named chunk of code that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>takes some inputs (called <em>arguments</em>),</li>
          <li>does some work,</li>
          <li>and optionally returns a result.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You have already seen functions like <code>print</code> in first-year programming. In
          this lecture we will mainly rely on <strong>built-in functions</strong> that come with
          Python itself. We are not defining new functions inside the examples yet; we are just
          practising how to <em>use</em> existing ones.
        </p>

        <h3>6.3 What is a built-in function?</h3>

        <p>
          Python provides many functions “out of the box”. These are called
          <strong>built-in functions</strong>. You do not need to import anything to use them.
          In Week 1 we rely on a small set:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong><code>len(x)</code></strong> – returns how many items are in <code>x</code>.</li>
          <li><strong><code>sum(x)</code></strong> – returns the total when you add all numeric items in <code>x</code>.</li>
          <li><strong><code>min(x)</code></strong> – returns the smallest item in <code>x</code>.</li>
          <li><strong><code>max(x)</code></strong> – returns the largest item in <code>x</code>.</li>
          <li><strong><code>print(...)</code></strong> – displays text and values in the output area.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The interactive examples below all follow the same pattern:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Store a small dataset as a list of numbers.</li>
          <li>Use built-in functions to compute summaries (length, total, average, minimum, maximum).</li>
          <li>Use a simple <code>for</code> loop to count how many values meet a condition.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- 7. INTERACTIVE EXAMPLES -->
        <h2 id="demo">7. Interactive Examples – Lists &amp; Simple Summaries</h2>

        <p>
          Each of the three playgrounds below is deliberately simple and focuses on one context:
          exam scores, temperatures, and study time. All three use the same ideas: lists,
          built-in functions, and <code>for</code> loops. There are no user-defined functions or
          external libraries in Week 1’s code.

          You can walk slowly through each example in turn: first read the list, then ask the
          room what <code>len</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code>
          will return before you run the code. Each example is the same pattern in a different
          context.

        <!-- 8. HOW MODULE RUNS -->
        <h2 id="module-run">8. How Lectures &amp; Labs Fit Together</h2>

        <p>
          Each week, the lecture introduces concepts and small examples like the ones above.
          The lab then gives you more time with a keyboard to apply the same ideas to slightly
          larger or more realistic datasets.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In Week 1 labs, you will work with tiny datasets represented as lists and practise
            writing simple summaries and counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Week 2, you will move from data typed directly into code to data stored in files
            (for example, CSV), and start thinking about basic loading and parsing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Later weeks will make heavier use of libraries such as NumPy and pandas, but they are
            built on the patterns you see here: collect values, filter them, summarise them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 9. RECAP -->
        <h2 id="recap">9. Recap &amp; Self-check</h2>

        <h3>9.1 Key points from Week 1</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Programming for data analysis starts from <strong>questions about data</strong>, not from syntax.</li>
          <li>A dataset can be pictured as a table: rows are observations, columns are variables.</li>
          <li>Common questions are descriptive (“what is typical?”), comparative (“are these groups different?”), relational, and predictive.</li>
          <li>A simple workflow – Ask → Obtain → Clean → Explore → Model → Communicate – underlies the rest of the module.</li>
          <li>Lists, built-in functions like <code>len</code> and <code>sum</code>, and basic loops are still the foundations of most analyses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.2 Self-check prompts</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you describe a dataset from your own life and identify its observations and variables?</li>
          <li>For any of the lists in the examples, what does each call to <code>len</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code> tell you in words?</li>
          <li>Which part of the workflow (Ask, Obtain, Clean, Explore, Model, Communicate) feels most familiar and which feels new?</li>
          <li>Do you know how you will run Python for this module (browser playground, lab machines, your own laptop)?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Next week</span>
          In Week 2 we keep the datasets small but move them into files. You will see how to read
          text files and CSVs, and how to turn file contents into the kind of lists you worked
          with in this lecture so that the same summary patterns still apply.
