        <!-- 1. WHAT IS A COMPUTER? -->
        <h2 id="computers">1. What Is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>
          A computer is an electronic device that can <strong>store</strong> data and
          <strong>follow instructions</strong> to transform that data. Although modern computers
          look very different (phones, laptops, watches, car dashboards), a lot of them share the
          same basic structure.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Von_Neumann_architecture.svg"
               alt="Simplified diagram of a computer: input, output, memory, control unit, arithmetic and logic unit"
               style="max-width: 480px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;">
          <figcaption>
            A simplified view of a computer: <strong>input</strong>, <strong>output</strong>,
            <strong>memory</strong>, and a <strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>At a high level, we can think of a computer as having:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input devices</strong> – keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, microphone, camera.</li>
          <li><strong>Output devices</strong> – screen, speakers, printer, vibration motor.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory</strong> – where data and instructions are stored.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong> – the &#8220;brain&#8221; of the computer:
            <ul>
              <li>Performs calculations and comparisons.</li>
              <li>Decides which instruction to run next.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The CPU repeatedly performs a simple cycle:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Fetch</strong> the next instruction from memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Decode</strong> it (figure out what it means).</li>
          <li><strong>Execute</strong> it (do the operation: add, compare, jump, etc.).</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Key Idea</span>
          A computer is <strong>fast but stupid</strong>. It can perform billions of simple
          operations per second, but only if we provide precise, unambiguous instructions.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Mini activity (2–3 minutes):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>List three devices you used today that count as computers (not just “laptop”).</li>
          <li>For each one, identify one input and one output.</li>
          <li>Notice how many computers are &#8220;hidden&#8221; in everyday objects.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 2. WHAT IS A PROGRAM? -->
        <h2 id="program">2. What Is a Program?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>program</strong> is a precise sequence of instructions that a computer can execute.
          It tells the computer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What <strong>data</strong> to use (input).</li>
          <li>What <strong>steps</strong> to perform (processing).</li>
          <li>What <strong>results</strong> to produce (output).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.1 Human Language vs Computer Language</h3>
        <p>
          Humans are good at dealing with <em>vague</em> instructions:
          “Can you send me that thing later?” usually works.
          Computers are terrible at this. They require instructions that are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exact</strong> – no missing steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Unambiguous</strong> – only one possible meaning.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete</strong> – everything needed to reach the goal is specified.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box box-warn">
          <span class="box-title">Important</span>
          A computer <strong>cannot guess</strong> what you meant. If the instructions are vague,
          contradictory, or incomplete, the program will either crash or do the wrong thing.
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Data and Programs in Memory</h3>
        <p>
          Modern computers store <strong>programs in memory alongside data</strong>. The same
          memory chip might hold:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The instructions that define your web browser.</li>
          <li>The text of the page you&#8217;re reading.</li>
          <li>Your typed responses and settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is called the <strong>stored-program concept</strong>. You don&#8217;t need to
          remember the name, but it explains why computers can load and run different programs so flexibly.
        </p>

        <!-- 3. ALGORITHMS -->
        <h2 id="algorithms">3. Algorithms: Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Before we write code, we need to describe <em>how</em> to solve a problem. An
          <strong>algorithm</strong> is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          A step-by-step method for solving a problem or achieving a goal.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You already use algorithms in everyday life: recipes, directions, assembly instructions,
          checklists, and so on.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Tea_processing_chart_II.svg"
               alt="Flowchart showing steps in tea processing"
               style="max-width: 650px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;">
          <figcaption>
            An example of an algorithm represented as a flowchart (steps in processing tea leaves).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>3.1 Properties of a Good Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input</strong> – what information does it start with?</li>
          <li><strong>Output</strong> – what result does it produce?</li>
          <li><strong>Definiteness</strong> – each step is clear and unambiguous.</li>
          <li><strong>Finiteness</strong> – it eventually finishes, rather than looping forever.</li>
          <li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> – each step is simple enough to be carried out mechanically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Everyday Example: Making a Cup of Tea</h3>
        <p>Informal version:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Boil water.</li>
          <li>Put a teabag in a cup.</li>
          <li>Pour boiling water into the cup.</li>
          <li>Wait a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove the teabag.</li>
          <li>Add milk/sugar if desired.</li>
          <li>Drink.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For a computer (or a very literal robot), we would need to be much more precise:
          how much water? how hot? how long is &#8220;a few minutes&#8221;? what if there is no teabag?
        </p>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Programming Mindset</span>
          When you think like a programmer, you start noticing all the hidden assumptions in
          everyday instructions. Programming is partly about <strong>removing</strong> those assumptions.
        </div>

        <h3>3.3 Activity: Write an Everyday Algorithm</h3>
        <p><strong>(10–15 minutes, discussion in class or self-reflection)</strong></p>
        <p>Pick one of these tasks (or invent your own):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brushing your teeth.</li>
          <li>Locking up your house when you leave.</li>
          <li>Making a sandwich.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Write down the steps as if explaining to a very literal robot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put <strong>one action per line</strong>.</li>
          <li>Avoid vague words like “some”, “a bit”, “properly”.</li>
          <li>Look for decision points: <em>If there is no bread, then…</em></li>
          <li>Look for repetition: <em>Stir until no lumps remain.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 4. FROM ALGORITHMS TO CODE -->
        <h2 id="algorithms-code">4. From Algorithms to Code</h2>
        <p>
          A computer cannot understand human languages directly. We need a way to turn our
          algorithm (idea) into something a computer can execute. This is where
          <strong>programming languages</strong> come in.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Levels of Description</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Informal description</strong> – “Find the largest of three numbers.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Algorithm (natural language or pseudocode)</strong> – step-by-step instructions that a human can follow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Code</strong> – the algorithm written in a formal programming language like Python.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.2 Pseudocode (Not Real Code Yet!)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudocode</strong> looks a bit like programming, but it’s written for humans,
          not machines. There is no single “correct” syntax; the goal is clarity.
        </p>
        <p>Example: find the largest of three numbers <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>:</p>
        <pre>Set largest to a
If b is greater than largest:
    Set largest to b
If c is greater than largest:
    Set largest to c
Output largest</pre>

        <p>
          Different people might write this slightly differently, and that&#8217;s fine. Once
          the algorithm is clear, we can translate it into Python in a later lecture.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Activity: Pseudocode for a Simple Problem</h3>
        <p><strong>(10 minutes)</strong></p>
        <p>Write pseudocode for one of these tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Given three test scores, compute the average and say whether it is a
            <em>pass</em> or <em>fail</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given a person’s age, decide whether they are a <em>child</em>,
            <em>teenager</em>, <em>adult</em>, or <em>senior</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Focus on the logic, not on Python syntax. Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the inputs?</li>
          <li>What is the output?</li>
          <li>What decisions (if any) are needed?</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 5. MEET PYTHON (OPTIONAL DEMO WITH CODE CARD) -->
        <h2 id="python-preview">5. Meet Python</h2>
        <p>
          In this module we will use the <strong>Python</strong> programming language.
          Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence,
          automation, and more.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Its syntax is relatively simple and readable.</li>
          <li>It runs on many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, the web).</li>
          <li>There is a huge ecosystem of libraries and learning resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this course, you will run Python code directly in your browser using the embedded
          editor and terminal on this page. In later weeks we will depend on this heavily.
          For now, here is a <em>single, optional</em> first interaction with Python.

          why in future lectures.

        <p>
          We will not go deeper into syntax today. The important takeaway is that we now have a
          way to turn our ideas (algorithms) into something a computer can execute.

        <h2 id="recap">6. Recap &amp; Self-check</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Key Ideas from Week 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A computer is a device that stores data and follows instructions to process it.</li>
          <li>
            A program is a <strong>precise sequence of instructions</strong> that a computer can execute.
          </li>
          <li>
            An algorithm is a <strong>step-by-step method</strong> for solving a problem, independent of any code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good algorithms have clear inputs and outputs and are finite, definite, and effective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programming languages like Python let us express algorithms in a form a computer understands.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Quick Concept Quiz (for yourself)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Which of these is <strong>not</strong> an algorithm?
            <ol type="a">
              <li>A recipe for baking a cake.</li>
              <li>Directions from your house to campus.</li>
              <li>A random list of unconnected words.</li>
              <li>Instructions for assembling a bookshelf.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Why do computers need precise instructions?
            <ol type="a">
              <li>They cannot guess what you meant.</li>
              <li>They execute instructions very literally.</li>
              <li>They get bored easily.</li>
              <li>They cannot fill in missing steps like humans can.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            True or False: An algorithm must involve a computer to be an algorithm.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>6.3 Reflection</h3>
        <p>In 2–3 sentences, answer for yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What was the most surprising or interesting idea for you in this lecture?</li>
          <li>Can you describe one everyday activity as an algorithm?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Next Time</span>
          In Week 2, we start using Python as a smart calculator. We will explore
          basic data types (integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and strings) and
          see how Python evaluates simple expressions.
