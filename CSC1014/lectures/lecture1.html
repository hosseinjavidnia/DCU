          <h1>Week 1 – What Is Programming?</h1>

          <p class="lede">
            Welcome to CSC1014. This week we are not trying to turn you into a programmer overnight.
            Instead, we are building the mental model you will use for the rest of the module:
            what computers are, what programs are, and how everyday instructions relate to algorithms.
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout-goal">
            <span class="callout-title">Lecture goals</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Describe what a computer does at a high level.</li>
              <li>Explain what a program is and why precision matters.</li>
              <li>Recognise everyday activities as algorithms.</li>
              <li>Understand how algorithms are translated into programming languages.</li>
              <li>Briefly meet Python, the language we’ll use in this module.</li>

          <span class="callout-title">Big picture</span>
          Today is about concepts, not details. If you leave this lecture
          seeing recipes, instructions, and checklists as algorithms, you’re in the right place.

        <!-- 1. WHAT IS A COMPUTER? -->
        <h2 id="computers">1. What Is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>
          A computer is an electronic device that can <strong>store</strong> data and
          <strong>follow instructions</strong> to transform that data. Although modern computers
          look very different (phones, laptops, watches, car dashboards), a lot of them share the
          same basic structure.
        </p>

        <figure>

               alt="Simplified diagram of a computer: input, output, memory, control unit, arithmetic and logic unit"
               style="max-width: 480px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;">
          <figcaption>
            A simplified view of a computer: <strong>input</strong>, <strong>output</strong>,
            <strong>memory</strong>, and a <strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>At a high level, we can think of a computer as having:</p>
        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <strong>Input devices</strong>
            <p>Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, microphone, camera.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <strong>Output devices</strong>
            <p>Screen, speakers, printer, vibration motor.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <strong>Memory</strong>
            <p>Where data and instructions are stored.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <strong>CPU</strong>
            <p>Performs calculations and decides which instruction to run next.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The CPU repeatedly performs a simple cycle:
        </p>

        <div class="pill-steps">
          <div class="pill-step">Fetch</div>
          <div class="pill-sep">→</div>
          <div class="pill-step">Decode</div>
          <div class="pill-sep">→</div>
          <div class="pill-step">Execute</div>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Key Idea</span>
          A computer is <strong>fast but stupid</strong>. It can perform billions of simple
          operations per second, but only if we provide precise, unambiguous instructions.
        </div>

        <h3>1.1 Different kinds of computers</h3>
        <p>
          When we say “computer”, most people picture a laptop or desktop. But from a programming
          point of view, many everyday objects count as computers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A smartphone running apps.</li>
          <li>A smartwatch tracking your steps.</li>
          <li>A car’s onboard system controlling engine and sensors.</li>
          <li>A games console, smart TV, or even your washing machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of these contain one or more CPUs, some memory, and programs that control how they behave.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Myth vs reality</h3>
        <div class="split-row">
          <div class="split-card">
            <strong>Myth:</strong> A computer is “smart”.<br>
            <strong>Reality:</strong> A computer follows instructions blindly and literally.
          </div>
          <div class="split-card">
            <strong>Myth:</strong> Programming means “talking to the computer”.<br>
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Programming means writing <em>precise rules</em> that the computer obeys.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Mini activity (2–3 minutes):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>List three devices you used today that count as computers (not just “laptop”).</li>
          <li>For each one, identify one input and one output.</li>
          <li>Notice how many computers are “hidden” in everyday objects.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 2. WHAT IS A PROGRAM? -->
        <h2 id="program">2. What Is a Program?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>program</strong> is a precise sequence of instructions that a computer can execute.
          It tells the computer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What <strong>data</strong> to use (input).</li>
          <li>What <strong>steps</strong> to perform (processing).</li>
          <li>What <strong>results</strong> to produce (output).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.1 Programs you already use</h3>
        <p>
          Even if you’ve never written code before, you probably use dozens of programs every day:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your web browser, email client, and messaging apps.</li>
          <li>Maps and navigation apps that compute routes.</li>
          <li>Photo and video apps that transform images and sound.</li>
          <li>Banking apps, online shopping sites, games, and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Behind each of these is code: someone wrote instructions that describe exactly how the
          program should respond to your input.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Human Language vs Computer Language</h3>
        <p>
          Humans are good at dealing with <em>vague</em> instructions:
          “Can you send me that thing later?” usually works.
          Computers are terrible at this. They require instructions that are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exact</strong> – no missing steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Unambiguous</strong> – only one possible meaning.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete</strong> – everything needed to reach the goal is specified.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box box-warn">
          <span class="box-title">Important</span>
          A computer <strong>cannot guess</strong> what you meant. If the instructions are vague,
          contradictory, or incomplete, the program will either crash or do the wrong thing.
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Data and Programs in Memory</h3>
        <p>
          Modern computers store <strong>programs in memory alongside data</strong>. The same
          memory chip might hold:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The instructions that define your web browser.</li>
          <li>The text of the page you’re reading.</li>
          <li>Your typed responses and settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is called the <strong>stored-program concept</strong>. You don’t need to
          remember the name, but it explains why computers can load and run different programs so flexibly.
        </p>

        <div class="activity-box">
          <span class="box-title">Think–pair–share (5 minutes)</span>
          <p>(Or simply think + jot down notes if you are working alone.)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pick one app or website you use a lot.</li>
            <li>List three things it can do in response to your actions (e.g. “when I click X, it does Y”).</li>
            <li>For each one, imagine the invisible program instruction behind it.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. ALGORITHMS -->
        <h2 id="algorithms">3. Algorithms: Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Before we write code, we need to describe <em>how</em> to solve a problem. An
          <strong>algorithm</strong> is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          A step-by-step method for solving a problem or achieving a goal.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You already use algorithms in everyday life: recipes, directions, assembly instructions,
          checklists, and so on.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Everyday Example: Making a Cup of Tea</h3>
        <div class="split-row">
          <div class="split-card">
            <strong>Informal (Human):</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Boil water.</li>
              <li>Put a teabag in a cup.</li>
              <li>Pour boiling water into the cup.</li>
              <li>Wait a few minutes.</li>
              <li>Remove the teabag.</li>
              <li>Add milk/sugar if desired.</li>
              <li>Drink.</li>

              <li>How hot?</li>
              <li>What if there are no cups?</li>

            </ul>
          </div>

        <div class="box box-info">
          <span class="box-title">Programming Mindset</span>
          When you think like a programmer, you start noticing all the hidden assumptions in
          everyday instructions. Programming is partly about <strong>removing</strong> those assumptions.
        </div>

        <h3>3.3 Three basic patterns in algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sequence</strong> – do one step after another in order.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection</strong> – choose between two or more paths (e.g. “if it is raining, take an umbrella”).</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition</strong> – repeat some steps (e.g. “stir until the sugar dissolves”).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most programs you write in this module will be built by combining these three patterns.
          Later, you will see them again as <strong>statements</strong> in Python:
          normal lines of code (sequence), <code>if</code> (selection), and <code>while</code>/<code>for</code> (repetition).
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Activity: Write an Everyday Algorithm</h3>
        <div class="activity-box">
          <span class="box-title">Activity</span>
          <p><strong>(10–15 minutes, discussion in class or self-reflection)</strong></p>
          <p>Pick one of these tasks (or invent your own):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Locking up your house when you leave.</li>
            <li>Making a sandwich.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Write down the steps as if explaining to a very literal robot:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Put <strong>one action per line</strong>.</li>
            <li>Avoid vague words like “some”, “a bit”, “properly”.</li>
            <li>Look for decision points: <em>If there is no bread, then…</em></li>
            <li>Look for repetition: <em>Stir until no lumps remain.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you’re done, check:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Did you clearly state the <strong>starting point</strong> (inputs)?</li>
            <li>Did you clearly state the <strong>goal</strong> (output)?</li>
            <li>Could someone else follow your steps without improvising?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. FROM ALGORITHMS TO CODE -->
        <h2 id="algorithms-code">4. From Algorithms to Code</h2>
        <p>
          A computer cannot understand human languages directly. We need a way to turn our
          algorithm (idea) into something a computer can execute. This is where
          <strong>programming languages</strong> come in.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Levels of Description</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Informal description</strong> – “Find the largest of three numbers.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Algorithm (natural language or pseudocode)</strong> – step-by-step instructions that a human can follow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Code</strong> – the algorithm written in a formal programming language like Python.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In this module we will spend a lot of time moving between (2) and (3): from algorithm
          to code and back again.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Pseudocode (Not Real Code Yet!)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudocode</strong> looks a bit like programming, but it’s written for humans,
          not machines. There is no single “correct” syntax; the goal is clarity.
        </p>
        <p>Example: find the largest of three numbers <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>:</p>
        <div class="pseudo-block">Set largest to a
If b is greater than largest:
    Set largest to b
If c is greater than largest:
    Set largest to c
Output largest</div>

        <p>
          Different people might write this slightly differently, and that’s fine. Once
          the algorithm is clear, we can translate it into Python in a later lecture.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Sequence, selection, and repetition in code</h3>
        <p>
          Remember the three basic patterns of algorithms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sequence</strong> – in code, this is just one statement after another.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection</strong> – implemented with <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition</strong> – implemented with <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In Week 1 and Week 2 we focus more on the ideas. In later weeks you will see exactly how
          these patterns look in real Python code.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Activity: Pseudocode for a Simple Problem</h3>
        <p><strong>(10 minutes)</strong></p>
        <div class="activity-box">
          <span class="box-title">Activity: Pseudocode</span>
          <p>Write pseudocode for one of these tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              <em>pass</em> or <em>fail</em>.

        <!-- 5. MEET PYTHON (OPTIONAL DEMO WITH CODE CARD) -->
        <h2 id="python-preview">5. Meet Python</h2>
        <p>
          In this module we will use the <strong>Python</strong> programming language.
          Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence,
          automation, and more.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Its syntax is relatively simple and readable.</li>
          <li>It runs on many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, the web).</li>
          <li>There is a huge ecosystem of libraries and learning resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.1 How Python runs your code</h3>
        <p>
          Python is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language. That means an interpreter reads
          your program and executes it line by line. In this course:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will type Python code into an editor in the browser.</li>
          <li>The browser sends your code to a Python interpreter (Pyodide) running behind the scenes.</li>
          <li>The interpreter executes your instructions and sends the output back to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This setup means you don’t have to install anything to get started.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this course, you will run Python code directly in your browser using the embedded
          editor and terminal on this page. In later weeks we will depend on this heavily.
          For now, here is a <em>single, optional</em> first interaction with Python.
        </p>

          Python is <strong>case-sensitive</strong>. <code>print()</code> is correct, but
          <code>Print()</code> or <code>PRINT()</code> will cause an error. We’ll explore
          why in future lectures.
        </div>

        <h3>5.2 Mini tasks with Python</h3>
        <p>Try editing the code above and then pressing <strong>Run</strong> again:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Change the message inside the quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Add another line with <code>print("Your own message here")</code>.</li>
          <li>Remove one of the closing quotation marks and run it – see what error appears.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don’t need to understand the error message yet. For now, just notice that
          <strong>small changes in your instructions</strong> can completely change what
          the computer does.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will not go deeper into syntax today. The important takeaway is that we now have a
          way to turn our ideas (algorithms) into something a computer can execute.

        <h3>6.1 Key Ideas from Week 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A computer is a device that stores data and follows instructions to process it.</li>
          <li>
            A program is a <strong>precise sequence of instructions</strong> that a computer can execute.
          </li>
          <li>
            An algorithm is a <strong>step-by-step method</strong> for solving a problem, independent of any code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good algorithms have clear inputs and outputs and are finite, definite, and effective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programming languages like Python let us express algorithms in a form a computer understands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most programs can be broken down into <strong>sequence</strong>, <strong>selection</strong>,
            and <strong>repetition</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

          In Week 2, we start using Python as a smart calculator. We will explore
          basic data types (integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and strings) and
          see how Python evaluates simple expressions.
